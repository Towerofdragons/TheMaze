# The Maze Project

## Description

The Maze is a raycasting-based demo that simulates a 3D environment using 2D rendering techniques. Built in C with SDL2, the project showcases a simple maze environment where the player can navigate through walls and view objects from a first-person perspective. This technical demonstration highlights core raycasting principles, such as calculating distances, rendering walls, and handling movement within a grid-based map.

Here's a [blog](#) that details my experience writing this game!

## Installation

1. Install SDL2
To compile and run The Maze, youâ€™ll need SDL2, which is a popular and handy library for handling graphics, input, and audio in C/C++.

**On Linux(Ubuntu/Debian)**

* Update package lists:

` sudo apt update`

* Install SDL2 and development packages

` sudo apt install libsdl2-dev `

* Install Additional SDL2 libraries for media handling eg, loading textures:

` sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev `


2. Clone and compile the project

* Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
* Compile the game using the pre-included makefile!

` make all `
 
 > The makefile automatically runs the game.

 > A result of the make command also is an executable so use the executable to launch the game next time.


## Usage
Run the game after compiling.
`./maze `

This game can be modified at will and is actively being worked on to get a grip on how this manner of game development works.
Have a great Run!
